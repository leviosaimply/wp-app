### Deployment and Management Outline

## Prerequisites
Ensure `minikube` and `docker` is installed locally to test this. Run `minikube start` and then follow these steps.

1. **Prepare Kubernetes Cluster**:
   - Ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is set up and configured properly.

2. **Create Kubernetes Resources**:
   - Create the necessary Kubernetes resources (Deployments, Services, Secrets, and ConfigMaps) by applying the YAML files (`mysql-deployment.yaml` and `wordpress-deployment.yaml`) in the `deployments` folder using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Confirm that MySQL and WordPress pods and services are created and running using `kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services`.
   - Ensure accessibility to the WordPress application via the configured NodePort.

4. **Test Connectivity**:
    - Access the WordPress application through a web browser by navigating to `http://<node_ip>:<node_port>` (replace <node_ip> and <node_port> with the appropriate values). You can also execute `minikube service wordpress --url` to get the exact endpoint.
    - Verify that you can log in to WordPress using the username and password configured in the `wordpress-deployment.yaml` file.

5. **Perform Functional Testing**:
   - Test various features of the WordPress application, including content creation, media uploads, and plugin functionality.

6. **Monitor Application Performance**:
   - Utilize Kubernetes monitoring tools to monitor MySQL and WordPress performance, including resource utilization and application logs.

7. **Scaling**:
   - If needed, scale the MySQL and WordPress deployments up or down using `kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=<replica_count>`.

8. **Rolling Updates**:
   - Perform rolling updates to deploy new versions of the MySQL or WordPress containers. Update the container image version in the respective Deployment YAML files and apply the changes using `kubectl apply -f <filename>`.
   - Monitor the rollout status using `kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment_name>`.

9. **Rollback**:
   - If a deployment has issues, rollback to a previous version using `kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment_name>`.

10. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
    - Implement backup strategies for the MySQL database, such as regular database backups using tools like `mysqldump` or database replication.
    - Establish disaster recovery plans to recover from catastrophic failures or data loss scenarios, including off-site backups, data replication, and automated failover mechanisms.
    - Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they are effective and reliable in real-world scenarios.
